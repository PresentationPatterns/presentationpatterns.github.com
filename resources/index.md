<h2>Pppst: Presentation Patterns Projector Sanity Test Deck</h2>
<p>
We've refreshed the Presentation Patterns Projector Sanity Test slide deck, or "Pppst" as we like to call it, in both <a href="http://presentationpatterns.com/assets/presentations/pppst-presentation-patterns-projector-sanity-test.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="http://presentationpatterns.com/assets/presentations/pppst-presentation-patterns-projector-sanity-test.key">Keynote</a> formats.

This slide deck is a helpful tool for testing a projector prior to giving a talk. The deck facilitates checking the colors, contrast, crop, dead pixes, and alignment of the projector setup.
