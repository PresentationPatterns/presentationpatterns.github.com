	share the knowledge of many presenters with the world of
	occasional and frequent presenters. The result is this book:

		<h1>Why?</h1>
		<p>
			Improving every aspect of a seemingly soft skill such as presenting is difficult to act on when the
			suggestions are abstract. Patterns provide a series of steps and implementation details that make
			presentation improvement easily actionable.
