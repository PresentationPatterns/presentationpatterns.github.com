			Neal is writing this book because he has seen too many tedious, boring presentations at conferences. He has spoken at over 200 developers conferences and presented more than 2000 talks over the last decade. If he doesn't know a bunch of stuff about presentations by now, he's either not paying attention or he's an idiot.
