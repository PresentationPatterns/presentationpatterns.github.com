# Techniques for Crafting Better Presentations

[Neal Ford](http://nealford.com), Matthew McCullough, and Nate Schutta sat down four years ago at a table and discussed how to collect, write about, and share the knowledge of many presenters with the world of occasional and frequent presenters.

# Why?

Improving every aspect of a seemingly soft skill such as presenting is difficult to act on when the suggestions are abstract. Patterns provide a series of steps and implementation details that make presentation improvement easily actionable.

# What?

Presentation Patterns is a book of over 100 recipes that provide actions to perform and avoid and context as to why you should or should not perform.

# How? 
The book is divided into three major sections: Prepare, Build, and Deliver.  This allows readers to drill in, even with a presentation deadline looming, and improve the content and impact of their talk via actionable and bite-sized instructions.
