<h1>Glossary</h>

<p>Pattern Names are the very <i>raison d'être</i> of the book. They are
		meant to be always memorable, generally descriptive,
		and occasionally humorous. Our observation is that once a behavior, product, or idea
		is named, it can be more effectively and concisely
		referenced amongst colleagues. Once able to be
		efficiently referenced, that pattern can be more
		frequently implemented, or if an anti-pattern,
		avoided.</p>

<p>You can think of patterns as similar to recipes, but patterns operate
		at a lower level than recipes. A recipe has steps, and
		the steps consist of instructions like “sauté” or
		"peel." Patterns resemble the lower-level steps found
		inside recipes; the techniques you must master to be
		considered a master chef or master presenter. You can
		use the patterns in this book to construct your own
		recipes for different contexts such as busi- ness
		meetings, technical demonstrations, and scientific
		expositions and keynotes, which we discuss in the
		concluding chapter. Second, there’s no such thing as
		an “antirecipe.” Recipes are by their nature positive
		because they are about building something. But many of
		the problems in the pre- sentation world come from the
		decades-long presence of tools that encourage bad
		habits. One of the most useful parts of the patterns
		move- ment in software is the identification of
		antipatterns—common but not obvious mistakes to
		avoid. A significant portion of our advice is about
		how not to fall into common bad habits that tools and
		years of bad exem- plars promote.</p>
