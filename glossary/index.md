		<p>This is a first draft of the full catalog of patterns referenced in the Presentation Patterns book.</p>
    <p>Pattern Names are the very <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i> of the book. They are meant to be always memorable, generally descriptive, and occasionally humorous. Our observation is that once a behavior, product, or idea is named, it can be more effectively and concisely referenced amongst colleagues. Once able to be efficiently referenced, that pattern can be more frequently implemented, or if an anti-pattern, avoided.</p>
    <p>Feedback and comments are welcomed. Just drop the authors an email at <a href="mailto:info@presentationpatterns.com">info@presentationpatterns.com</a> or a tweet to <a href="http://twitter.com/ppatterns">@ppatterns</a></p>
