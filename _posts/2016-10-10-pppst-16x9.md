We've refreshed the Presentation Patterns Projector Sanity Test slide deck to create a widescreen, 16x9 version, as we're increasingly building talks in that format. You can download it in Keynote format <a href="http://presentationpatterns.com/assets/presentations/pppstWide-Presentation-patterns-projector-sanity-test.key">here</a>.

This slide deck is a helpful tool for testing a projector prior to giving a talk. The deck facilitates checking the colors, contrast, crop, dead pixes, and alignment of the projector setup.

We hope you benefit as much from using the slides as we do. Please spread it far and wide!
