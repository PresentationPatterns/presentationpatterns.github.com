Matthew gave a passionate version of his Information Alchemy talk at the [Denver Open Source User Group (DOSUG)](http://denveropensource.org/) during their February, 2010 [Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/) night lineup. The talk was very well received and has, since then, been given in at least 10 others venues, including the [No Fluff Just Stuff conference series](http://nofluffjuststuff.com/).
