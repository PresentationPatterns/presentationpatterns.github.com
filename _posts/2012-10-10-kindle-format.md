We're excited that The Presentation Patterns book is now available in both [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Patterns-Techniques-Presentations-ebook/dp/B0093J9K14/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) and [ePub](http://www.informit.com/store/presentation-patterns-techniques-for-crafting-better-9780321820808) formats, in addition to the [paperback format](http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Patterns-Information-Alchemy-Presentations/dp/0321820800/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1326465927&sr=1-2).

The book currently holds a [4.8 out of 5 stars](http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Patterns-Techniques-Presentations-ebook/dp/B0093J9K14/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) rating on Amazon. We believe that's a reflection of a resource that helps others do the teaching and presenting they are passionate about, but better than ever before.
