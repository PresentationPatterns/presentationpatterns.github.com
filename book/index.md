		Once in a while, an inflection point appears in a well established practice. Those who see a new, better way to do something don't just move away from the desultory pack, they accelerate away. Presentation techniques have reached just such an inflection point.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Books like Presentation Zen and Slide:ology describe a new approach to using tools that have been around for decades, like PowerPoint and Keynote. Both are wonderful books.
		</p>

		But the three of us are software geeks. Reading about a new philosophy of presentations is one thing, but we like concrete instructions. In the architect and software ecospheres, the concept of a pattern exists as a way to create standard terms for solutions to common problems. A pattern describes a set of related concepts in a standard format, with a memorable name. For example, in the software world, you can say "I need an object which can only be instantiated once, and all subsequent attempts to create a new one returns the lone instance" or you can say "I need a Singleton". The Singleton design pattern is defined in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Design, which provides a well known, concise way to refer to a common technique.

		<p>
		Patterns are a bit like recipes, but with an important distinction: there is no such thing as an "anti-recipe". In the software world, an anti-pattern is a common cliche, fallacy, or poor design. Unfortunately, most of the presentations we've seen will benefit first by un-doing years of damage caused by too-eager tools and literally no instruction on how to build good presentations. Our book contains mostly patterns (recipes), but it also includes anti-patterns (things to avoid), so that you don't find yourself bringing a knife to a gun fight.

		The working title is Presentations Patterns (and Anti-patterns). This book provides more than 50 (and counting) patterns and anti-patterns for creating extremely effective and engaging presentations.
